## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to showcase how you can dynamically change the visual properties of a `<div>` element on a web page using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The HTML file contains five dropdown menus, each corresponding to a different property of the `<div>`. When a user selects a value from a dropdown menu, the corresponding property of the `<div>` is updated in real-time.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. The page will display a `<div>` element with initial properties set for demonstration purposes. You will also see five dropdown menus labeled as follows:
   - Color
   - Background Color
   - Padding
   - Font Size
   - Font Weight

4. Select a value from any of the dropdown menus to change the respective property of the `<div>` element. The changes will be applied instantly.

5. Experiment with different combinations of property changes to see how the appearance of the `<div>` can be altered.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styling of the `<div>` element.
- JavaScript: DOM manipulation for updating properties based on user select.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code included in the `<script>` tags of the HTML file provides the functionality to change the properties of the `<div>` element based on the user's selections from the dropdown menus.

Here's a brief overview of how each dropdown is handled:

- `changeColor()`: This function is triggered when the "Color" dropdown is changed. It fetches the selected color value from the dropdown and applies it to the `color` property of the `<div>` element.

- `changeBgColor()`: Similar to `changeColor()`, this function updates the background color of the `<div>` element based on the selected value from the "Background Color" dropdown.

- `changePadding()`: When the "Padding" dropdown is changed, this function retrieves the selected padding value and applies it to the `padding` property of the `<div>`.

- `changeFontSize()`: This function handles the font size property. It gets the selected font size value from the "Font Size" dropdown and sets it as the `font-size` property of the `<div>`.

- `changeFontWeight()`: Finally, when the "Font Weight" dropdown changes, this function applies the selected font weight value to the `font-weight` property of the `<div>`.

These JavaScript functions enable real-time updates to the `<div>` element's properties, allowing users to interactively customize its appearance.
